# DR VISION 
<h2> Problem Statement</h2>
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a complication of diabetes that affects the eyes. It is caused by damage to the blood vessels in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. DR is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. It is estimated that over 90 million people have DR, and over 25 million people are blind from DR. There are two main types of DR: nonproliferative DR (NPDR) and proliferative DR (PDR). NPDR is the earlier stage of DR. In NPDR, the blood vessels in the retina leak or swell. PDR is the more severe stage of DR. In PDR, new blood vessels grow on the surface of the retina. These new blood vessels are fragile and can break easily, causing bleeding into the eye. DR is usually asymptomatic in the early stages. This is why it is important to get regular eye exams, even if you have no symptoms. There is no cure for DR, but early detection and treatment can help to prevent vision loss. Treatment options for DR include laser surgery, injections into the eye, and surgery.<br>

<h2> Solution :</h2>
<h3> DR VISION </h3>
DR Vision or Diabetic Retinopathy vision is an AI/ML Model that can Detect DR and provide necessary prevention and the most viable solution of avoiding readmission in hospitals.
<h2> Benefits of DR VISION </h2>
- <b>Early Detection:</b> Identifies signs of diabetic retinopathy at an early stage.<br>
- <b>High Accuracy:</b> Provides precise analysis of retinal images, reducing human error.<br>
- <b>Efficient Screening:</b> Reduces the workload on healthcare professionals, allowing them to focus on complex cases.<br>
- <b>Increased Accessibility:</b> Extends screening capabilities to remote or underserved areas.<br>
- <b>Cost-Efficiency:</b> Leads to potential cost savings in healthcare systems.
Timely Intervention: Enables swift action to prevent vision loss or complications<br>

<h2> Core Concept of DR VISION </h2>
The Core concept in the construction of DR Vision is CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)<br>
It is a Deep-learning concept that is used in image clarification, image recognition, and processing.<br>
<b>How to implement CNN in DR VISION?</b> <br>
1.	Collect a dataset of retinal images from people with and without DR. This dataset should be as large and diverse as possible to ensure that the CNN learns a robust set of features.<br>
2.	Preprocess the retinal images. This may involve resizing the images, normalizing the pixel values, and removing any noise from the images.<br>
3.	Split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the CNN, and the testing set will be used to evaluate the performance of the CNN.<br>
4.	Design and implement the CNN architecture. The CNN architecture should be designed to extract the features that are most relevant for DR detection.<br>
5.	Train the CNN on the training set. This involves feeding the training images to the CNN and adjusting the CNN's parameters so that it can accurately classify the images.<br>
6.	Evaluate the performance of the CNN on the testing set. This involves feeding the testing images to the CNN and measuring their accuracy.<br>
7.	Deploy the CNN to production. Once the CNN is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed to production so that it can be used to detect DR in new retinal images.<br>


  <h2> How to Access DR Vision ? </h2>

    python Finalmodel.py
    
<li> Launch the app </li>
    DR Vision Should be started....
</ol>
  
<h2> How DR Vision Works ?  </h2>
  <ol>
    <li> The user should first take an ophthalmoscopy Test in a certified eye laboratory .</li>
    <li> The report is the input for DR vision system. Upload the report to DR vision.</li>
    <li> Once the Report has been submitted DR Vision Analyses the report and then predicts whether a person has Diabetic Retinopathy.   </li>
    	<li>If the result is positive then the AI generates the commonly practiced cure and precautions for early cure and to avoid re-admission in hospitals for DR .</li>
	<li>If the result is negative the AI generated the prevention methods for the patient so that they could prevent DR.</li>
  </ol>
